Many a young cook has discovered their cooking eggs hatching, and what came out was not a sweet little baby animal, as is the case in most of the tasty animal world. I once lost an entire breakfast crew, slaughtered by the unexpected hatching of a clutch of eggs. Their fiery spit and nasty bite had overwhelmed my cooks. By the time I discovered them, most of the hatchlings had fed so well that I had to call the city guard to remove fully transformed draconian flamers, crushers and chargers. Which good cooks know are far too gamey to be good eating.\" <br> <i>--Cooking all of Nature, by Emibeek, Ogre Gourmet</i>\"",

The warrior's compatriots surrounded the dwarf cripple who wore a crossbow accross his back. The gray dwarf limped forward, straightening before the mob and said in a tired voice: 'Axeman. Did it thirty years. Had to bury a hunderd friends, all for Honor. Pinned in a canyon, surrounded by archers. Honor didn't save them. Left for dead, I was.' The crowd hushed. Together our eyes all seemed to notice the crossbowman's wooden leg. 'Lost it to an arrow. Your gravestone, that's your honor. I keep mine on my back.' He patted his crossbow, passing through the stilled ruffians unmolested..\" <br> <i>--Honor's Price, by Duren Dirkhammer, Historian</i>\"",

No animal traverses rugged terrain with such speed. Though legends vary, most agree she was captured by a clever and nameless Axeman who demanded she marry him. Together they started a family and formed a clan. Later rival clans started to include boar riders as well. Nowadays boar riders are common from many origins, and still they revere the nameless Axeman by wielding a poleaxe, and they spare no expense on the finest dwarven armor in honor of the love the wild dwarf woman had for her boar..\" <br> <i>--Dwarf Society Made Simple, by Lord Milligan</i>\"",

When I heard of Frostling encroachments into the Elven Court territories, I sought an opportunity to pursue my studies. I surrendered, volunteering my freedom for the hope of learning. The first real discovery is that Frostling society is matriarchal. Frostling males labor for Ice Queens and their White Witch daughters. I watched a White Witch blast her opponents with ice of such intensity that it burns when it strikes. She is the frozen north. They command perfect respect from Frostlings.

Our spies keep losing track of their numbers, but our mission remains the same. Still, I am confident our forces are sufficient.

My fine warriors clad in armor, astride their mounts, roared with indignant fury. The goblins quivered as if to scared to flee.

The first was scrawny and bleated to go across the bridge, promising his two older, fatter brothers would come and be easier to catch. So the greedy troll let the first go, licking his chops. The second satyr came. It told the hungry troll that his fatter brother would be tastier and even easier to catch. So it let him pass. Of course, you know how this story ends. No third brother came, because there were only two satyrs. So the troll ate the poisonous mushrooms that always grew there in abundance because no one else can eat them without dying.

In his day, the tyrant Phobius would enslave whole cities of Halflings, forcing them to perform humiliating songs and dances in silly costumes. Dressed as a Jester, Beaver stole a wagonload of pyrotechnics and hid himself in a forested wilderness. When the Phobian Empire came for him, Beaver repelled them with his explosive projectiles. Over time many Halflings joined him and Beaver led them all to freedom. To this day, their descendants wear costumes and keep fireworks handy for the defense of their kin. Well, that, and they really love blowing things up.\" <br> <i>--Half a History, by Lamuel Samanite, Lorekeeper</i>\"",

It's something of a game among the wee folk, and playing on the other side are the Nightwatch, who patrol the streets, keeping society \"honest\"-or so they say. I suspect the local thieves guilds secretly bankroll these infantryman, because they never seem to catch Halfling thieves. Instead, they focus on foreigners not familiar with the ways these stealthy guards sneak about, often more efficiently hidded in the shadows than the rogues they claim to hunt. It is no wonder that Nightwatchmen are said to have once been thieves themselves.

Attacked from behind, the dangerous creature thrashed about in surprise for a moment, finding no target for its tusks, and then laid down its life. The eagle then proceeded to dine upon the corpse in perfect health. This one vision inspired the Halfling animal-handler, Campo Friendfeather, to befriend these flying fighters. The great birds use their speed and powerful claws to destroy foes everywhere on the battlefield, directed by their halfling riders who bonded with the birds since they struggled from their eggs.\" <br> <i>--Halfling Hall of Fame, by Sat Babbin, Keeper</i>\"",

All our swordsmen are outfitted with fine plate mail, and a long sword that we've personally tested on the strongest dwarven armor. I've seen them rush and overwhelm whole cadres of goblins on the field of battle, rendering them powerless from our fierce offensive.

The priest lifted the sword above his head and said we were chosen by a greater power, and that, if we did not doubt, we'd vanquish this evil. He cast down the orc blade, It broke at the hilt.

The poor fool impaled on the point of his lance made no sound before dying. The marauders tried to strike him, but his steel armor deflected every blow. With sword drawn, the knight chopped down any who did not surrender. He refused my offer to pay him for putting his life in danger for our village. He said 'My duty is to die in battle for this Land. Your duty, my lady, is to live and suffer for this Land.' Long after his name faded from my memory, I have wondered what gravestone belongs to him. That's why I bring flowers for them all.\" <br> <i>--Rise of the Common Man, by Goody Curtez, Scrivener.</i>\"",
